## Introduction

___ncurses___ (new curses) is a free software emulation of curses in System V Rel 4.0 (and above).
It uses terminfo format, supports pads, colors, multiple highlights, form characters and
function key mapping. Because of the interactive nature of this library, it will be of
little use for writing Web applications, but may be useful when writing scripts meant
[using PHP from the command line](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php).

This repository was started to support the use of ___PECL ncurses___ which ~~has been deprecated~~
in ___PHP 7 and later versions___. Therefore, the development direction of this extension is ___only
to provide support for the upper version of PHP___.
